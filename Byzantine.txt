The "Byzantine Generals Problem" states that no two computers on a decentralized network can entirely and irrefutably guarantee that they are displaying the same data. Assuming the network is unreliable, they can never be sure that the data that they communicated has arrived. At its core, the Byzantine Generals Problem is achieving a consensus across a distributed network of devices, some of which could be potentially faulty, while also being weary of any attackers attempting to undermine the network.
